"""
Spatial Analysis Module for Toronto Hotel Analysis

This module provides functions to calculate real distances between hotels and events,
and create meaningful spatial features for hotel pricing analysis.

PERFORMANCE NOTE: This module has been optimized to eliminate slow iterrows() operations
and uses vectorized operations for production ML pipelines.
